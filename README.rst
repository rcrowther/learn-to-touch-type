Learn To Touch Type
===================
Python-GTK GUI for learning how to touch-type.

Requires
~~~~~~~~
Python3, GTK environment.

Install
~~~~~~~
The install instructions use hand-installed Ninja/Meson. Sadly, these do not work for the newish repository versions. Until I get to update, you can always paste the lines in using Bash---there are only about six of them.

    off we go

This GUI is intended for those who have never used a computer keyboard. It may seem like a scrappy piece of utility software which wouldn't impress anyone, and why use that? Because it's a scrappy piece of utility software which wouldn't impress anyone. And if that's what you think, well, I know you think it's a denial of your rights, but you go think that. Go buy a fancy typing tutor. This program has several calculated and tested design decisions built in, and is based on years of experience. It is like it is for good reasons.

Which is not to say it needs no more work, because it does. And when will GTK sort itself out? After they deprecate the entire codebase?

Hint: the buttons are for tutors.
