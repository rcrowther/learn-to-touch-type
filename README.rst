    off we go

This GUI is intended for those who have never used a computer keyboard before. It may seem like a scrappy piece of utility software which wouldn't impress anyone, and why use that? If that's what you think, well, I know you think it's a denial of your rights, but you go think that. Go buy a fancy typing tutor. This program has several calculated and tested design decisions built in, and is based on years of experience. It is like it is for good reasons.

Which is not to say it needs no more work, because it does.
